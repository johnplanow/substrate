## Dev Workflow — Testing Local CLI Changes

**IMPORTANT:** The `substrate` command is a globally installed published version — it does NOT run your local changes.

To test local CLI changes:
1. Build first: `npm run build`
2. Run via: `npm run substrate:dev -- <args>`

Example: `npm run substrate:dev -- run --events --stories 10-1`

**Never run bare `substrate` to test local changes.** It will silently use the published version, not your code.

## Substrate Pipeline

This project uses Substrate for automated implementation pipelines.

### Quick Start
- Run `substrate run --help-agent` to get full pipeline interaction instructions
- Run `substrate run --events` to execute the pipeline with structured event output
- Run `substrate run --events --stories 7-1,7-2` to run specific stories

### Agent Behavior
- On story escalation: read the flagged files and issues, propose a fix, ask the user before applying
- On minor fix verdict: offer to fix automatically
- Never re-run a failed story without explicit user confirmation
- After pipeline completion: summarize results conversationally (X succeeded, Y failed, Z need attention)
